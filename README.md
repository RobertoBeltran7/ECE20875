# **ECE 20875: Python for Data Science**

**Course Description:**
This course introduces Python programming through data science problems. Python concepts are explored as well as introductory data science topics, and are used to implement data analyses.

### **List of HW Assignments**

- **HW3: Histograms and Distributions**<br/>
This assignment has functions that will find the optimal number of histogram bins in a data set. The functions are also used to identify the type of distribution presented by the data set.

- **HW4: Higher-Order Functions**<br/>
This assignment introduces the use of higher-order functions in Python.

- **HW5: Sampling, Hypothesis Testing, and Confidence Intervals**<br/>
This assignment introduces hypothesis testing and confidence intervals in Python.

- **HW6: Regular Expressions**<br/>
This assignment introduces regular expressions and how they can be implemented in Python.

- **HW7: Bash Scripting**<br/>
This assignment introduces basic bash scripting that can redirect input/output and uses environment variables.

- **HW8: Linear Regression**<br/>
This assignment goes over several regression topics and introduces use of the **numpy** and **sklearn** libraries.

- **HW9: N-grams and Natural Language Processing**<br/>
This assignment introduces methods to analyze n-gram distributions of several languages. It also introduces use of **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit).

- **HW10: K-means Analysis**<br/>
This assignment introduces k-means analysis on a data set using methods, objects and classes.

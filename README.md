# **ECE 20875: Python for Data Science**

**Course Description:**
This course introduces Python programming to students through data science problems. Students learn Python concepts as well as introductory data science topics, and use their knowledge of Python (and prior programming experience) to implement data analyses.

### **List of HW Assignments**

- **HW3: Histograms and Distributions**<br/>
This assignment has functions that will find the optimal number of histogram bins in a data set. The functions are also used to identify the type of distribution presented by the data set.

- **HW4: Higher-Order Functions**
This assignment introduces the use of higher-order functions in Python.

- **HW5: Sampling, Hypothesis Testing, and Confidence Intervals**
This assignment introduces hypothesis testing and confidence intervals in Python.

- **HW6: Regular Expressions**
This assignment introduces regular expressions and how they can be implemented in Python.

- **HW7: Bash Scripting**
This assignment introduces basic bash scripting that can redirect input/output and uses environment variables.

- **HW8: Linear Regression**
This assignment goes over several regression topics and introduces use of the **numpy** and **sklearn** libraries.

- **HW9: N-grams and Natural Language Processing**
This assignment introduces methods to analyze n-gram distributions of several languages. It also introduces use of **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit).

- **HW10: K-means Analysis**
This assignment introduces k-means analysis on a data set using methods, objects and classes.
